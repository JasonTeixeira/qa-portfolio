## Observations

- The reviewed signer, managed-project, and database-project authority pins are not provisioned.
- ACADEMY_EVALUATOR_PRIVATE_SPEC_ROOT is not configured.
- No signed activation attestation proves the managed isolated runtime.
- All three runtime images need digest pins or a valid signed activation attestation.
- Staging has not supplied release-bound evidence that migrations 0116 through 0120 are applied.
- The managed Vercel Sandbox project binding is missing, mismatched, or not attested.
- No valid Ed25519 activation attestation proves private references, adversarial probes, and receipt reconciliation.
- Release-bound monitoring and alerting evidence is absent.
- Mastery writes remain disabled by the two-part release kill switch.
