# SageIdeas Local Production Candidate handoff

Local Production Candidate is not deployment approval. It proves the safe-local repository gates only.

## Local proof

- Release: `local-candidate-2026-09-05-988e703b`
- Commit: `988e703b343c987fe7b09a79effeb1d04ec9d74e`

- Status: `local_production_candidate`
- Observations: 23, failures: 0
- Dependencies: 0 known vulnerabilities
- Academy remains uncertified.
- Labs remain practice-only and `untrusted_current_runtime`.

## Pre-deploy

- [ ] Explicit external approval and named deployer/reviewer
- [ ] Target Vercel project, Supabase project, region, release commit, and environment confirmed
- [ ] Runtime variables configured from the manifest names without copying values into evidence
- [ ] Hosted migrations reviewed, backed up, and tested on an isolated target
- [ ] Rollback target and triggers agreed before mutation

## Staging

- [ ] Apply approved migrations and reconcile the hosted ledger
- [ ] Exercise auth/MFA, tenant isolation, billing/webhooks, communications/jobs, storage, and the five controlled evaluator labs
- [ ] Prove alert delivery, scrubbed Sentry traces, health/SLO signals, rate limits, and kill switches
- [ ] Run assistive-technology checks, field-like performance, rollback, and restore drills

## Post-deploy

- [ ] Verify active release identity, public health, critical customer journeys, audit events, queues, and provider receipts
- [ ] Monitor at least one agreed alert window and retain evidence
- [ ] Obtain the required human review and controlled-beta decision

## Rollback triggers

- readiness fails twice within five minutes
- a critical customer journey fails
- security or data-integrity regression
- error signals exceed the approved threshold

## External approval boundaries

- [ ] staging_deployment: approval_required
- [ ] hosted_migrations: approval_required
