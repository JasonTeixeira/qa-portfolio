/**
 * Append one verified evidence event. Service-role only; append-only.
 *
 * @security CALLER CONTRACT — the anti-cheat guarantee lives here, not in the DB:
 *  1. `userId` MUST be sourced from the authenticated session (`auth.getUser()`),
 *     NEVER from request/route/form input. The service role bypasses RLS, so a
 *     spoofed `userId` would write to another learner's ledger (IDOR).
 *  2. `payload` MUST be constructed server-side from VERIFIED facts (the lab
 *     actually verified output; the AI guide actually graded the explain-back).
 *     NEVER forward a client-supplied payload. In particular `externalOutcome`
 *     is admin/grader-only — it lifts the final 98-cap and must never be settable
 *     by a learner-triggered flow.
 *  3. Emit the event only AFTER the underlying check passed — this is the write
 *     of record, not a request to check.
 *
 * Defense-in-depth (independent of the caller contract above):
 *  - `type` is validated against the known event-type allowlist before insert.
 *  - Grader/admin-only payload keys (externalOutcome, boardAsset, …) are STRIPPED
 *    unless `opts.trusted` is set — so even a buggy caller forwarding a client
 *    payload can't lift a cap. No flow today sets `trusted` (no real grader yet),
 *    so these keys are always stripped — which is correct.
